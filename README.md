List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:

* Loading Screen
* Home Page With the weekends Music Schedule

What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.

* React Native
* Possibly Ignite or Another CLI

If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.

* Workshop Schedule Page
* Live Update Schedule Page - Shows what is happening currently, what just happened, and will happen next.
* Artist Page - List of Artists and their Bio



We'll use these steps to plan and develop our capstones over the next two Fridays.

1. Break the UI into a Component Hierarchy


# Project Layout MVP:
  Home/Loading Screen with enter button to enter into the app:

  Next Screen Shows The Full Weekends Music Schedule on one page.

#  Project Layout past MVP:

  Home/Loading Screen with enter button to enter into the app:

  Next Screen Shows a menu with options to look at artists/ workshops/ or schedules

  This Home screen will show what artists the last artist to have played, who is playing now, and who is playin next. <- This will only work on weekend of event if all goes well.

  Artist Page will be a grid layout of each artist. Picture, name, short bio, style of music, when they play.

  Workshop will be a grid layout of all the workshops in order of when they will be happening, they will have a brief description of what the workshop is about and who is teaching it and when and where it will be happening.

After outlining a layout/design you're happy with, sketch out the corresponding component structure in a diagram.

Add the visual representation of your layout/appearance and a component tree diagram to your repo before advancing.
2. Build a Static Version
Using your component tree diagram, build a static version of the app using only functional components. Hard-code any data you plan on eventually receiving from APIs, databases, Redux, or other sources for now.

Before advancing, add a link to your static site's repo to your planning repo.
3. Identify the Minimum (But Complete!) Representation of UI State
Now that your application is more than just user stories, carefully consider how you'll organize its state. Outline what state slices you'll need, and how they'll be structured. Be careful here; incorrectly structured state can later lead to tricky issues.
